# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- The project uses xampp for sql server hosting thus configurations on the server side for database name and table name should be made

For getting started
- ```cd backend```
- ```npm i```
- ```npm start```

- The server will be running on http://localhost:3030
- For fronted 
- ```cd ..```
- ```npm i```
- ```npm run dev```

N/B: Be sure to have created a database, add a table and updtate the fields on the server.js file in the backend part
# Adding the required field soon
